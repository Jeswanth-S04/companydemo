								<p>In an economy that is becoming increasingly digital, businesses have needed to keep pace with fast-changing digital demands. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these demands even more, while also creating new marketplace opportunities. To capitalize on these opportunities — and to not get left behind ⁠— businesses across a variety of industries have accelerated their digital transformation plans. And to prepare for any future disruptions and to navigate general uncertainty, businesses are strengthening their resilience and are becoming more agile.</p>

									<h3>Work</h3>
								</header>
								<p>When our client is in need of solution capabilities to explore new strategic directions while its core team is busy with ongoing business needs, or requires an immediate time-to-market product line that calls for a technology skill set it currently doesn’t have, we provide a solution engineering team with the needed skills to deliver innovative solutions and products. In this time-boxed model, we own the responsibility of delivering the software features or components within scope, budget, and time schedules.</p>
